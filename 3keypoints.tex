The key points of this work are:

1. Electron holes of finite transverse extent are subject to trapped orbit
losses arising from the violation of magnetic moment conservation.

2. Detrapping is calculated analytically and verified by numerical
orbit integration, finding the phase space that can sustain the hole.

3. The results appear to offer a qualitative explanation for some
trends concerning electron hole aspect-ratio observed in space
plasmas.
