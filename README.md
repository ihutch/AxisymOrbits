# AxisymOrbits
Codes for calculating orbits in axisymmetric electron holes
The various Fortran codes in this repo perform the calculations reported in the paper by I H Hutchinson called
Particle Trapping in Axisymmetric Electron Holes (submitted to JGR). 
If you really want to try to reproduce the results then clone this repo. If you are on a linux machine, the
executable file may simply run. In that case you can regenerate almost all the figures by doing . plotcomp.sh
If you need to recompile the code, try "make <executable_name>". If you want to know what the programs do, 
read the paper and read the fortran (.f90) files! Good luck!
